<h2> Hey there! I'm Randy.</h2>

<h3> About Me </h3>

I am a former platform administrator and electrician turned software/data engineer who is passionate about automation and data.

I have a diverse background in automation, technical support, SaaS administration, construction, and data science. My 
career has so far been a winding journey: studied Computer Science at Virginia Tech, worked in technical support and 
SaaS platform administrator positions, 7 years full time as an electrician, and now as a data engineer. These different 
experiences and environments have allowed me to develop my own unique set of skills, from problem-solving to 
communication and project management.

I am, at heart, a problem solver, and am passionate about creating efficient and consistent solutions through critical 
thinking and automation. I have had the privilege of working with many people from wildly different walks of life and 
pride myself on creating efficient and practical solutions that best serve my clients' needs.


When I'm not busy automating and optimizing workflows, you can find me surfing at my local break, playing board games 
with friends, or jamming out to the latest metalcore and fusion-jazz releases!
